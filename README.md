# Event Booking Application

A Laravel-based RESTful API for managing events, attendees, and bookings.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Conceptual Breakdown

#### 1. **Frontend (e.g., Web or Mobile Application)**
   - Makes HTTP requests to the API for interacting with the backend.

#### 2. **API Layer (Controllers)**
   - **BookingController**: Handles booking requests like creating a booking, retrieving bookings for events or attendees, and deleting bookings.
   - **Validation**: Ensures the data sent by the client is correct (e.g., checks if the event is full or if the attendee has already booked the event).

#### 3. **Application Layer (Models and Business Logic)**
   - **Event Model**: Represents events and handles the relationship to bookings (capacity, event details).
   - **Attendee Model**: Represents attendees and manages their bookings.
   - **Booking Model**: Represents the booking relationship between an attendee and an event. It ensures that a booking isn‚Äôt created if it violates business rules (e.g., if the attendee is already booked or if the event is at capacity).

#### 4. **Database Layer (Database Tables)**
   - **events**: Contains data related to the event (name, description, start time, end time, capacity).
   - **attendees**: Contains data related to the attendee (name, email, etc.).
   - **bookings**: Stores the booking relationship between attendees and events (event_id, attendee_id).
